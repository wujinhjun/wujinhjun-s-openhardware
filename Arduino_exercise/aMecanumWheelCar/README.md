# This is a simple example about The arduino car

In the winter vacation, I want to make a remote control car. At the same time, I'm a designer, so it is hard for me to make a mechanism for transmission and steering. Therefore, I choose the mecanum wheel. For better control, I choose a shield for my Arduino UNO.  

It is worth mentioning that because I can't find sensors in my hometown, this car only has basic metion logic for the time being.
