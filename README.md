# wujinhjuns-openhardware
The beginning of wujinhjun's openhardware road  
Last semester, I was exposed to open source hardware for the first time and find that I like the feeling of interacting with hardware. So that, I bulid this repository to document my learning journey  
As a designer, I try to learn a lot of interesting thing, maybe including Arduino, Maixduino, Raspberry Pi and some new thing.
